# Fall 2023-Spring 2024 Center for Digital Scholarship, IUPUI Univeristy Library
# Author: Teryn Morgan

# Description
This project was completed through my role as a Digital Scholarship Assistant in the Center for Digital Scholarship, IUPUI University Library. 
# Problem
The University Library conducts an annual review system to compile IUPUI faculty written publications and upload them to IUPUI ScholarWorks in accordance with the Open Access Policy (OAP). This OAP workflow depends on accurate faculty self-reporting to identify eligible works for metadata extraction. Due to this dependency, ScholarWorks is not capturing all works affiliated with IUPUI faculty authors. 

# Goal 
Search large literature databases (Clarivate, Elsevier, Lens, Academic Analytics) to extract works authored by IUPUI faculty in 2021-2022. These works are then deduplicated against works that have already been retrieved through the annual review system.
